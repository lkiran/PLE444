						<h1>TWENTY FIRSTH REPORT</h1>		
					</div>				
					<p>Our aim for this meeting was starting to screen design of our GBS. When, we tried to make some hand made screens, Hamdi Erkunt visited our meeting. He read and asked certain questions to us about our cover story. We realized that our cover story has many deficiencies. Although we talked about who is the protocol, what the obstacle and the purpose are in the previous meeting, we could not express those clear enough.</p>	
					<br>
                    <p>After the suggestions, we decided to revise our cover story. Therefore, we went back to the cover story of the third draft and made certain changes. </p><br />
                   
                     <h3>1.a. Cover Story</h3>	
					
                    <p>Can the chosen one put pieces together and save his country from the attacks of the neighbor country?</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>1.b. Revised Cover Story</h3>

                    <p>The country is in chaos. The government needs the help of the talented agent, who used to work for the government a long time ago. Can he give the government what they want to save his wife? </p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>2.a. Story</h3>

                    <p>There are two countries sharing a border. One of them is planning to attack the other but firstly to conquer easily, they want to create a domestic disturbance and a civil war. They attack 4 different regions with 4 varied ways. All attacks are directed to weaken people’s thinking ability to make them vulnerable and guarantee the victory. There is one person who does not affect from these attacks. He will try to solve problems, inform the authorized people and save his country. </p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>2.b. Revised Story</h3>

                    <p>	The country has a huge amount of underground wealth which is desired by other countries. Other countries try to cause a chaos in the country to make it weaken. By this way, the country will be open to the help and collaboration of them, which wait for an opportunity to use the underground wealth of the country. To avoid this, the country tries to overcome the chaos on its own by the help of the special agents. However, these attempts remain inconclusive and the only way/solution is to call the most talented agent who used to work for the government for a long time. However, he does not accept the duty because of the past experiences which showed the government’ true colours to him. He just want to remain his simple but happy life with his wife. Therefore, the government abduct his wife to oblige him to collaborate. </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>After the revision of the story and the cover story, we focused on the screen design. This was the most controversial part of our work so far. We tried to negotiated on the screen designs and the aim of every task. The introduction and the first task design are roughed out.</p><br />

                    <p>The next meeting, we are going to complete screen design outlines and move forward.</p>
