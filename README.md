# Personal Learning Environment (PLE)

PLE is a massive open online course (MOOC) platform that allows users to create, manage, and join courses. 
This project has started as my undergraduate department’s Community Service course's project, among those who take the course.
It is currently available and servicing the department’s instructors and students in their courses.
